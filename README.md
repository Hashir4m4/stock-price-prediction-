 Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a straightforward approach to forecasting stock prices using a linear regression model. The core of the project is built around processing historical stock data, training a model to predict future closing prices, and visualizing the results.

 Features

- Load and preprocess stock price data from CSV files.
- Convert date values into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
- Use scikit-learn's LinearRegression to train and predict stock closing prices.
- Visualize actual vs predicted stock prices with matplotlib.
- Predict the next day's closing price.

 How It Works

The script imports historical stock price data, converts dates into ordinal integers to be used as a feature, and splits the data into training and test sets. It fits a linear regression model on the training data and predicts stock prices on the test set. Results are visualized to compare actual and predicted prices. The model then projects the next day's closing price based on the trend.
